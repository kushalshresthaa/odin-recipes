    <h2>Description </h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a hearty, comforting Italian dish made of layers of wide pasta noodles, rich meat sauce (usually a blend of ground beef and marinara), creamy ricotta cheese, and a generous amount of melted mozzarella. Often topped with Parmesan, the layers meld together beautifully during baking, creating a satisfying combination of savory, cheesy goodness. </p>
        <p>The dish is typically baked until golden and bubbling, and when served, it offers a delicious balance of flavors and textures—soft pasta, savory sauce, and creamy cheese. Lasagna is a perfect crowd-pleaser, ideal for family dinners or special occasions, and can be easily customized with vegetables, different meats, or even a meatless option.</p>
