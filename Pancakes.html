    <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> Pancakes are fluffy, golden-brown discs of comfort food, often enjoyed as a breakfast treat but perfect for any time of day. They have a soft, airy texture on the inside, with a slightly crisp exterior when cooked just right. </p>
        <p>The flavor is subtly sweet, but it's the toppings that take them to the next level—whether it's a drizzle of maple syrup, a dollop of whipped cream, fresh berries, or a sprinkle of powdered sugar. Each bite is warm, light, and satisfying, making pancakes the perfect canvas for creativity in the kitchen, with endless variations like chocolate chips, banana slices, or even savory options.</p>
