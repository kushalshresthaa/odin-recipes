    <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> A PBA sandwich, short for Peanut Butter and Apple sandwich, is a simple yet satisfying snack made by spreading creamy or crunchy peanut butter onto slices of whole grain or your preferred bread, then layering thin slices of fresh apple on top. The apple adds a crisp, juicy sweetness that pairs perfectly with the rich, nutty flavor of the peanut butter. </p>
        <p> For extra flavor and texture, optional additions like a drizzle of honey, a sprinkle of cinnamon, or a handful of granola can be included. The sandwich is then topped with another slice of bread, cut in half, and enjoyed fresh. Itâ€™s a nutritious option that's quick to prepare, offering a balance of protein, fiber, and natural sugars. </p>
